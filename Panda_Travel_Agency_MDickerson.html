<figcaption> One final, but certainly not the last, activity vistors can do in the Vaadhoo Islands is to go on a catamaran ride either during the evening or during the day across the clear, beautiful ocean. This is a very popular activity especially for large groups of people who want to have a amazing boat ride.

		<dd>I had an AWFUL time at the Glowing Beach because of two reasons! My suitcase was stolen at the Glowing Beach Marriott and my daughter and I both got stung my jelly fish each day we went to the beach! I will NEVER go back and I do not recommend this beach at all. </dd>
